\section{Development of Research Questions}
\label{sec:background}

For a developer not proficient with the operations side of the process, transitioning to an integrated CI platform, like Travis CI, involves adaptation of their established processes to the new environment. During this transition, some developers will experience a more streamlined process evolution trajectory than others. Studying those trajectories can provide lessons learned.


%We expect the following to potentially change in the transition <need to write theory behind each>:
%
%On the developer side:
%Change in code writing/committing: we expect smaller change sets over time
%We expect More unit testing over time
%Operations side:
%More discussions in code review over time
%Different categories of initial faults

Continuous integration encourages developers to ``break down their work into small chunks of a few hours each'', 
as smaller and more frequent commits keep them to keep track of their progress and reduces the debug 
effort~\cite{Fowler,Duvall}. %Duvall [p. 31,38,40]
Based on these guidelines we formulate our \textbf{RQ1}: Are developers reducing the size of code changes in 
each commit post CI adoption? Do they continue to do so over time?

Size of the commit is closely related to commit frequency: indeed, the aforementioned quote from Fowler's blog refers to ``chunks of a few hours each''. 
In an early study Miller has observed that on average Microsoft developers committed once a day, while off-shore
 developers committed less frequently due to network latencies~\cite{Miller}; Stolberg expects everyone to 
 commit every day~\cite{Stolberg} and Y\"{u}ksel reports 33 commits per day after introduction of CI~\cite{Yuksel}. 
Hence, we ask \textbf{RQ2}: Are developers committing code more frequently?

For continuous integration to have the stated benefits, code review should play a prominent role~\cite{Miller}. 
In the very popular pull-request model of development, code review is done through open issues.
%\as{Can we say something about the popularity of the pull-request model of development in GH? Is this your work or GG's?} 
However, maintaining the process of code review has been recognized as one of the challenges when 
adopting continuous deployment~\cite{ClapsBSA}, software development technique related to continuous integration.
Hence, we study \textbf{RQ3}: Are developers transitioning to reporting more issues after the adoption of CI?

Finally, continuous integration is closely related to presence of automated tests~\cite{Fowler}. 
Duvall even claims that continuous integration without such tests should not be considered continuous integration 
at all~\cite{Duvall}, while Cannizzo, Clutton and Ramesh deem an extensive suite of unit and acceptance tests to 
be an essential first step~\cite{CannizzoCluttonRamesh}. 
Moreover, continuous integration is frequently introduced together with test automation~\cite{Yuksel}.
However, developing tests suited for automation requires change in developers' mind set and presence of a  comprehensive set of tests incurs additional maintenance costs~\cite{CoramBohner}.
Naturally, more automated testing will expose more errors, and CI makes it possible to track and react to different error types differently~\cite{BellerGZ16}.
%\as{Y\"{u}ksel reports increase of the number of automated tests but they have combined introduction of CI with automated testing~\cite{Yuksel}. }
Therefore, we pose the last research question,  \textbf{RQ4}: How does automated testing usage change over time after CI adoption? And how do build errors evolve over time? %\as{Not sure about the formulation; the word ``transition'' implies that in the beginning the developers do not use automated testing. Do we really check this?}
