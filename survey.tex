\section{Survey}
\label{sec:survey}
To obtain more profound insights in the adoption of \Tvis we have conducted a survey of software developers.

We have \as{how?} selected 335 projects from our dataset ensuring that in each project a different software  developer was responsible for introducing \Tvis. 
We have mailed developers responsible for introduction of \Tvis. Delivery of 23 messages failed.
Among the 312 (= 335-23) projects we have considered, 170 projects are stationary, 73 increase and 69 decrease.

We have received 56 responses.  
The response rate constitutes, therefore, 17.95\% comparable to the response rate in similar surveys of \GH software developers\as{add bib refs}.
To match the responses to the direction\as{bad word, to be replaced}  we have asked the respondents to provide the slug of the \GH repository \as{to be completed}

We have asked three questions: what made the developers decide to start using CI and \Tvis, whether they had to change anything in their development process to accommodate CI, and how did their development process change with time to use CI/\Tvis efficiently?
